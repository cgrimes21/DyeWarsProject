/// DyeWarsServer - Thread Safety Utilities
///
/// Debug assertions and utilities for enforcing
/// thread safety contracts at runtime.
///
/// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
/// --------------------
/// Thread safety bugs are the WORST kind of bugs because:
/// 1. They're non-deterministic - might work 99% of the time, crash 1%
/// 2. They're hard to reproduce - debugger changes timing, hides the bug
/// 3. They corrupt data silently - you don't know until much later
///
/// This file provides tools to CATCH these bugs early in development
/// by asserting "this code should only run on thread X".
///
/// In release builds, all of this compiles away to ZERO overhead.
/// In debug builds, it catches violations immediately with clear errors.

/// THREAD OWNER TRACKER
///
/// THE PROBLEM:
/// ------------
/// Your server has multiple threads:
///   - Game thread: runs game logic, modifies Player/World state
///   - IO thread: handles network I/O, reads/writes packets
///
/// If both threads access the same data without synchronization = DATA RACE.
/// Data races cause:
///   - Torn reads (reading half-updated values)
///   - Lost updates (two threads write, one wins, one loses)
///   - Memory corruption (half-written pointers = crash)
///
/// THE SOLUTION:
/// -------------
/// For game state (Player, World, SpatialHash, VisibilityTracker):
/// We enforce a contract: "This data is ONLY accessed from game thread."
///
/// ThreadOwner helps enforce this contract at runtime:
/// 1. At startup, call SetOwner() from the game thread
/// 2. In every method, call AssertOwner() to verify we're still on that thread
/// 3. If called from wrong thread → immediate assertion failure → easy to debug
///
/// ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
/// ----------------------
/// 1. Mutex: Lock data before access. Slower, but allows multi-thread access.
/// 2. Atomic: For simple values (int, pointer). No locking needed.
/// 3. Lock-free queues: Pass messages between threads instead of sharing data.
///
/// We chose "single-thread ownership" because:
/// - Game state is complex (maps, vectors, pointers)
/// - Locking everything would be slow and error-prone
/// - Game logic naturally runs on one thread anyway
///
/// HOW std::thread::id WORKS:
/// --------------------------
/// Every thread has a unique ID. std::this_thread::get_id() returns it.
/// We store the "owner" thread ID, then compare against current thread.
/// If they don't match → wrong thread → assertion failure.
///
/// USAGE:
/// ------
///   class MyClass {
///       ThreadOwner owner_;  // Declare in class
///   public:
///       void Init() {
///           owner_.SetOwner();  // Call once from owning thread
///       }
///       void DoWork() {
///           owner_.AssertOwner();  // Call at start of methods
///           // ... work ...
///       }
///   };

    ///
    /// NDEBUG is defined by the compiler in release builds.
    /// When defined, assert() becomes a no-op.

    /// We use the same pattern here:
    /// - Debug build: Full thread checking, catches bugs early

    /// This is called "zero-cost abstraction" - you get safety in development
    /// without paying for it in production.

    /// WHY memory_order_relaxed:
    /// -------------------------
    /// Atomics have "memory ordering" that controls how operations are seen
    /// by other threads. Options are (from weakest to strongest):
    ///
    /// - relaxed: No ordering guarantees, fastest
    /// - acquire/release: Synchronizes "before/after" relationships
    /// - seq_cst (sequential consistency): Strongest, slowest, global order
    ///
    /// We use relaxed because:
    /// 1. SetOwner() is called once at startup, before any contention
    /// 2. AssertOwner() just reads and compares, doesn't need ordering
    /// 3. If there's a race in setting owner, we have bigger problems

    ///
    /// HOW ASSERT WORKS:
    /// -----------------
    /// assert(condition) does nothing if condition is true.
    /// If condition is false, it:
    /// 1. Prints the condition, file, and line number
    /// 2. Calls abort() to terminate the program
    ///
    /// This is INTENTIONAL - we WANT to crash immediately on thread violations.
    /// A crash with a clear message is infinitely better than silent corruption.
    ///

/// FURTHER READING ON THREAD SAFETY
/// ============================================================================
///
/// DATA RACES vs RACE CONDITIONS:
/// ------------------------------
/// - Data race: Two threads access same memory, at least one writes, no sync.
///   → Undefined behavior. Compiler can do ANYTHING. Nasal demons.
/// - Race condition: Logic bug where outcome depends on thread timing.
///   → Defined behavior, but wrong results. Still bad, but debuggable.
///
/// C++ MEMORY MODEL (C++11 and later):
/// -----------------------------------
/// C++ has a formal memory model that defines:
/// - What operations are atomic (indivisible)
/// - How threads see each other's writes
/// - What ordering guarantees exist
///
/// Without atomics/mutexes, the compiler and CPU can reorder operations
/// in ways that break your assumptions. This is why "it works on my machine"
/// but crashes in production - different CPUs reorder differently.
///
/// TOOLS FOR FINDING THREAD BUGS:
/// ------------------------------
/// 1. ThreadSanitizer (TSAN): Compile with -fsanitize=thread
///    → Detects data races at runtime with minimal overhead
/// 2. Helgrind (Valgrind tool): Slower but catches more issues
/// 3. Static analysis: Clang-tidy has thread-safety annotations
///
/// PATTERNS FOR THREAD-SAFE CODE:
/// ------------------------------
/// 1. Immutability: If data never changes, it's always safe to read
/// 2. Thread-local: Each thread has its own copy (std::thread_local)
/// 3. Confinement: Only one thread ever accesses the data (what we use)
/// 4. Synchronization: Mutexes, atomics, condition variables
/// 5. Message passing: Threads communicate via queues, not shared state
///
/// Our server uses a combination:
/// - Game state: Confined to game thread (this file enforces it)
/// - Statistics: Atomics (can be read from any thread)
/// - Action queue: Message passing (IO thread → game thread)
/// - Client connections: Each connection has its own strand/socket
///
