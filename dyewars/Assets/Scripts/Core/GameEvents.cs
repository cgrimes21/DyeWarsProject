// GameEvents.cs
// All game events defined in one place. This makes it easy to see what events exist
// and what data they carry. Events are structs (immutable-ish, stack-allocated).

// Naming convention: [Subject][Verb]Event
// Examples: PlayerMovedEvent, PlayerConnectedEvent, PacketReceivedEvent
